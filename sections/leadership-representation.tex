\section{SIG Leadership and Representation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each SIG should designate a leader who will oversee the management and operations of the SIG.
\item SIG leaders \textbf{should} attend CompSoc SIG meetings.
\item If a SIG leader is unable to attend a meeting, they should attempt to designate another member of the SIG committee to attend and vote on behalf of the SIG.
\item Each SIG has one vote on any committee decision.
\item If disagreements about SIG leadership occur, the CompSoc Vice President or other elected committee members can mediate and assist in resolving the issue.
\end{enumerate}
