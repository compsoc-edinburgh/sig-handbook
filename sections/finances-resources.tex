\section{SIG Finances and Resources}
\begin{enumerate}
\item SIGs may seek their own sponsors, and any funds received will be allocated to that SIG, managed within the SIG’s or CompSoc’s bank account.
\item Funds raised by SIGs through sponsorships, event ticket sales, or other means shall be allocated to the SIG and can be spent at the SIG's discretion. These funds may be transferred to the SIG's bank account (if one exists).
\item SIGs can request additional funding from CompSoc for relevant events and activities
on top of sponsorship funding that they have secured.

\end{enumerate}
