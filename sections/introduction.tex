\section{Introduction}
This handbook serves to outline the policies of cooperation between Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and CompSoc. The purpose of this handbook is to ensure consistency in how SIGs operate and to clarify the support and resources CompSoc provides to SIGs.
\\ \\
The CompSoc Vice President serves as the point of contact between SIGs and the CompSoc committee\footnote{The CompSoc committee is comprised of the elected CompSoc committee and SIG leaders}. Therefore, if you are unsure
whom to contact, the Vice President should be your first point of contact. Otherwise, reaching
out to the relevant committee member is recommended.
