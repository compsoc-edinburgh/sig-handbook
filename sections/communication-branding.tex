\section{SIG Communication and Branding}
\begin{enumerate}
\item SIGs must acknowledge their affiliation with CompSoc as a Special Interest Group on their website and communication channels.
\item SIGs should use CompSoc's communication channels to promote their events and activities to a wider audience.
\item It is recommended that SIGs bridge the general and announcement channels of their SIG discord servers to a dedicated channel in the CompSoc discord server to help boost engagement.
\item The CompSoc Graphic Designer is available to provide support on branding and promotional materials.
\item SIGs must notify the CompSoc Secretary at least 72 hours prior to events if they wish to be featured in CompSoc announcements. If they wish to be featured in the weekly CompSoc newsletter, the Secretary should be notified before midnight on Friday (as the newsletter is sent out on Sundays).
